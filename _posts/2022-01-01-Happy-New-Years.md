Happy New Years everybody! Here's to hoping that your year is filled with joy, excitement and fulfillment of your goals.

I have a feeling that the cyber security landscape is going to be very active this year, especially considering the recent [Log4shell vulnerability](https://www.freshprinceofhacking.com/general/Log4Shell-Vulnerability/). Remember, it's never too late to raise your cyber awareness and security posture! This is field that's constantly evolving every day with new threats and defenses.

We can all create a safer internet environment for ourselves and others if we do our due diligence and keep up with what is out there. I know I've been slacking in posting content, but I will try to change that this year and have more frequent post regarding the latest cyber news. As always, if you have any recommendations or things you're generally curious about, hit me up! Be safe and have a blessed year.
